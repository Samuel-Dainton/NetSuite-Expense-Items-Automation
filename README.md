# Expense-Button
Together, these two scripts are used to add a button to item receipts going to a hub. When clicking the button, an Inventory Adjustment record is created based off of the Item Receipt. The items added to the IA are expensed items like nuts, bolts, zip ties and more. The items are adjusted out of inventory via an expense account.
